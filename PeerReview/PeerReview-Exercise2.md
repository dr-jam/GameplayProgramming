You only need to review code modified or created by the student you are reviewing. You do not have to review the code and project files that were given out by the instructor.

Abusive or hateful language or comments will not be tolerated and will result in a grade penalty or be considered a breach of the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct.

A successful submission should consist of a copy of this markdown document template that is modified with your peer-review. The file name should be the same as it is in the template: `CodeReview-Exercise2.md`. You also need to include your name and email address in the `Peer-reviewer Information` section below.
