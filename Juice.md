# Game Juice: A Lesson of Expanding Game Feel from Juice to Level Design

This take-home lesson is about one of the prominent game development discussions of the last few years: game juiciness. 
The study portion of the lesson consists of watching talks and analysis videos from prominent figures in the (mostly indie) game development community.
To assess the lesson, you should identify 3 take-away techniques or concepts per video that can be added to your game project.

## Study Videos

Watch the study vidoes in the following order:  

1. **[Juice It or Lose It](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1016487/Juice-It-or-Lose) by Martin Jonasson and Petri Purho in GDC Europe 2012.** This talk ignited a movement withing game development on increasing the juiciness (i.e. additional modes of community the intent and intensity of the game with the player past those identified by Swink in [Game Feel](http://www.game-feel.com/)) of games. *Juice It or Lose It* identifies several practical methods for adding additional juice to games by introducing them in a layered and compositional approach.
2. **[Why Does Celeste Feel So Good to Play?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yorTG9at90g) by Mark Brown of [Game Maker's Tookit](https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337/).** By applying the basic concepts of Swinkian game feel to indie game *Celeste* while analysing the game's mechanics in a way consistent with Juice, Brown bridges the space betwen to the two areas through examples and analysis. Through interviews with the designers of *Celeste* Matt Thorson and Noel Berry, Brown brings the impacts of composing the core game mechanics to light.
3. **[Level Design Workshop: Designing 'Celeste'](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024307/Level-Design-Workshop-Designing-Celeste) by Matt Thorson in GDC 2017.** This lesson's conversation between juice, mechanics, and design is continued into the realm of applied level design in this talk by Thorson. Thorson succinctly describes the basic mechanics in *[Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/)* and describes how they are applied to and create constraints for the 300+ levels designed for *Celeste*. As the description of the level design process progressions, Thorson shows the complexities of his design process in the forms of combinations of gameplay systems along with designing levels for multiple types of play ranging from novices to speed-runners.

## Task

Your task is to identify at least 3 concepts, rules of thumb, or tools from the study videos in a way that applies them to your game project.
