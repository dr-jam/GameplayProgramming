## Course Description

This course is about the design and development of nuanced and highly contextual gameplay systems built on the foundation of traditional game engines. Technical game development has many facets, including graphics engines, sound engines, networking, and animation systems. Many of these facets are well-established and provided for in modern game engines. The focus of this course is on the remaining areas that are difficult to abstract and engineer into game engines as they depend on the genre or details of a specific game design.

## Materials

Godot Engine version 4.3-stable Standard. Download [here](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/).

### Exercises
The programming exercises consist of projects in Godot in which you must implement significant game systems or capabilities. These exercises are to be completed individually and will be worth equal points. Each will have two components, which are described below with a typical amount of grade points they are worth:
1. [70] The individual programming assignment.
2. [30] Peer-reviewing the work of another pseudo-randomly assigned student.
 
*Individual Programming Assignment* - The exercise repositories, with project descriptions and work specifics, will be distributed via GitHub Classroom. You will be responsible for completing the exercise objectives, code quality, and following the best practices described in class. Final submissions will be made via GitHub Classroom.

*Peer review* - For each programming exercise, each student will peer review another student's work. The reviewing student will be given access to the repository of another student's submission for review. The peer reviewer will be responsible for a code review based on C# style guides, an assessment of how well the submission achieved the objectives of the assignment and notes for improvement. This review should be done in the master branch and in the root directory of the repo (the same folder that contains the assignment's README). 

### Group Game Project

You will design and develop your own game given a set of themes and constraints in teams. Each team member will have a main role and a sub-role in the game.

### Quizzes

Light quizzes may be given during class meetings. Their contents will be based on recent lectures and readings.

### Participation and Attendance

Students are required to attend and participate in class, labs, and team meetings. Attendance will be taken during lectures and discussion sections.

#### Participation

Each submitted participation code is worth 1 grade point. You need at least five codes to max out your participation grade.

#### Attendance

The attendance rules are suspended while the course is offered remotely.  

The attendance algorithm is as follows:  
AttendanceGrade = Min(5, 5 * (SubmittedAttendanceCodes / (ClassesWhereAttendanceWasTaken - 1)))

## Development and Design Resources


### Are you prepared?


[![World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Cinematic Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IBHL_-biMrQ/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IBHL_-biMrQ?t=142)  
*You are not prepared!*  
-- [Illidan Stormrage](https://youtu.be/IBHL_-biMrQ?t=142)

Illidan's words may resonate with you as computer science and game development are both difficult disciplines whose surrounding communities are laced with high expectations and elitism. (Materials for Godot are under development.)

### Preparing for Projects

Below is a set of training tutorials to learn the basics of Godot for use in this course. You should spend bewteen 5 and 10 hours on these tutorials depending on your experience level to prepare for the first exercise.

Here is the [Godot Tutorials for Gameplay Programming playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwfiwgNTrxLuE2X2bdBGHdwvJ5ZVF9my1).  

You should be comfortable with the following to begin the first exercise:
* How to create a project
* How assets are stored on the filesystem.
* The basic properties of the Godot editor's interface.
* Node and scene relationships and how to use them to compose basic game elements.

* GDScript's basic syntax, data structures, and use. This includes arrays, classes, and importing libraries.
* Godot's built-in functions (e.g., `_process` and `_ready`).
* The ability to add and alter input signals.
* Simple animation and motion.
* Git and GitHub. While these systems are expected of you coming in to the class, you can find some tutorials later in the syllabus.

## UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct

The UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct (http://sja.ucdavis.edu/files/cac.pdf) will be strictly enforced in this class. In particular, plagiarism, academic dishonesty, and cheating will be dealt with severely.  Any breach of the Code of Academic Conduct can result in failing the assignment, failing the course, and disciplinary action via the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs (http://sja.ucdavis.edu/).

## Technology in the Classroom Policy
In general, the use of laptops and technology is encouraged in this course as long as they are not disruptive to the rest of the class. If you choose to use a device with a screen, please sit in the back of the room to avoid distracting your fellow students. You must ask for permission before making a video or audio recording in the classroom. In general, students will be treated as adults capable of managing their technological lives while being respectful of others in the classroom.

## Social Media Policy
Students are not permitted to make visual or audio recordings, including live streaming, of classroom lectures or any class-related content using any recording device (e.g., smartphone, computer, digital recorder, etc.) unless prior permission from the instructor is obtained and there are no objections from any of the students in the class. If permission is granted, personal use and sharing of recordings and any electronic copies of course materials (e.g., PowerPoints, formulas, lecture notes and any classroom discussions online or otherwise) is limited to the personal use of students registered in the course and for educational purposes only, even after the end of the course.

To supplement the classroom experience, lectures may be audio or video recorded by faculty and made available to students registered for this class. Faculty may record classroom lectures or discussions for pedagogical use, future student reference, or to meet the accommodation needs of students with a documented disability. These recordings are limited to personal use and may not be distributed (file share), sold, or posted on social media outlets without the written permission of the faculty.

Unauthorized downloading, file sharing, distribution of any part of a recorded lecture or course materials. or using information for purposes other than the student's learning is prohibited unless the instructor gives prior authorization.
